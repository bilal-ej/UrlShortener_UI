This is a simple UI for to interact with the API I have created for the URL shortening challenge. 

IMPORTANT
- please ensure API project is running locally whilst running this UI project
- please ensure the correct local host address is configured on this project when running on your machine. Look for "UrlShortenerApiBaseUrl": ... inside the appsettings.json file.
 The local host address should be the same as the one from the window running swagger for the API on your local browser tab.
